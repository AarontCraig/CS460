                        <p>
                            In my sixth homework, I created a website and attached an existing product database. I used the Code First model,
                            and created a working website that can view all of the products, navgiate their data, and leave reviews. It was 
                            a long process, and took many hours, but I felt pretty good about the end result.
                        </p>
                        <ol class="rundown">
                            <li>The first thing I did was to create a new branch on my github website. I did this using the git commands:
                                <br><code>git branch -b HW6</code>
                                <br><code>git checkout HW6</code>
                                <br>And then I began working on that branch, pushing changes, creating files, all without affecting my main
                                branch. At the end, I merged them all together. This was the only part I didn't have any problems with.
                            </li>
                            <img src="Homework6\Images\landing_page.PNG" height="600" width="1000">
                            <br><br>
                            <li>
                                The first thing I began working on was the landing page. I needed to set up a navigation bar that could display
                                the main product categories as list items in the nav bar. This required dynamic code with Razor and foreach loops
                                to iterate over the database and get the proper information.
                                <br><br>
                                <xmp>
@foreach (var item in Model.ProductCategories)
{
    <li class="dropdown"><a class="dropdown-toggle" data-toggle="dropdown" href="#">@item.Name <span class="caret"></span></a>
        <ul class="dropdown-menu">
            @foreach (var cat in item.ProductSubcategories)
            {
                <li>@Html.ActionLink(cat.Name, "ChosenCategory", new { id = cat.ProductSubcategoryID })</li> <!--I need to pass the ProductSubcategoryID-->
            }
        </ul>
    </li>
}   
                                </xmp>
                                Razor is a built in programming language that can run in an HTML page, which is awsesome. It gives the programmer 
                                so much more power, like for loops, access to variables, and connection to the database. It took my a while to
                                get the foreach loops to iterate over the database properly, but once I had it figured out, I could display
                                both the ProductCategories and the ProductSubcateries.
                                <br>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Up next was learning how to dynamically display a list of products based on the ProductSubcategory selected
                                in the dropdown menu. I had to learn how to pass information around, and use @Html.ActionLink, another Razor
                                feature, that allowed me to pass an ID back to my controller. Once I figured that out, it became quite easy
                                to filter my database accordingly, and then display all the products in the subcategory.
                                <br><br>
                                <img src="Homework6\Images\subcategory_page.PNG" height="600" width="1000">
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                After the display page was working and I got things looking decent, I had to get reviews. I needed to both accept
                                reviews from users and display the stored comments there. I created a page for the user to leave their info and
                                a comment.
                                <br><br>
                                <img src="Homework6\Images\review_page.PNG" height="600" width="400">
                                <br><br>
                                I needed to save the information from the page and put it in the controller. The code to do that looks like this:
                                <xmp>
[HttpPost]
public ActionResult Review(FormCollection form, int? id)
{
    if (id == null)
        return RedirectToAction("Index");
    if (form.Get("user") == "" || form.Get("email") == "" || form.Get("comment") == "")
        return RedirectToAction("Review");
    var format = "MM-dd-yyyy HH:mm:ss:fff";
    var stringDate = DateTime.Now.ToString(format);
    var reviewDate = DateTime.ParseExact(stringDate, format, CultureInfo.InvariantCulture);
    var modifiedDate = DateTime.ParseExact(stringDate, format, CultureInfo.InvariantCulture);

    int rating = Convert.ToInt32(form.Get("rating"));

    var review = new ProductReview
    {
        ProductID = id.Value,
        ReviewerName = form.Get("user"),
        ReviewDate = reviewDate,
        EmailAddress = form.Get("email"),
        Rating = rating,
        Comments = form.Get("comment"),
        ModifiedDate = modifiedDate
    };
    db.ProductReviews.Add(review);
    db.SaveChanges();

    return RedirectToAction("Index");
}
                                </xmp>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                I had gotten most of the web pages working, but they were jerry-rigged and not very pretty. So I went in 
                                and created some ViewModels in my app. They are incredible, and allow me to pass data to views with Strongly
                                Typed help and checking. One of my ViewModels looked like this:
                                <xmp>
namespace HW6.Models.ViewModels
{
    public class ChosenCategory
    {
        public IEnumerable<ProductCategory> ProductCategories { get; set; }
        public IEnumerable<Product> ProductSubcategories { get; set; }
        public string PageTitle { get; set; }
        public IEnumerable<ProductProductPhoto> ProductPhotos { get; set; }
        public IEnumerable<ProductReview> ProductReviews { get; set; }
    }
}
                                </xmp>
                            </li>
                            <p>
                                I spent many hours on this project, but I also learned a lot. I know how to pass data around with the MVC
                                model. I have a much better understanding about the seperation of control, how to create ViewModels, and 
                                I feel confident in being able to connect databases to web apps.
