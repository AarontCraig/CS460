                <p>In the first assignment we were tasked to learn Git, create a repo and work from it, build our own
                    website using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. I'd never heard of bootstrap before, but I'd worked with
                    all of the other tools/langugaes before, so I was confident I could complete the homework. Design work,
                    like website creation is some of my least favorite work, but technically speaking I think I was able
                    to meet all of the requirements of the homework.
                </p>
                <ol class="rundown">
                    <li>To begin, I created an account on GitHub.com. It's a fantastic website for hosting anything, but
                        works especially well for code and computer projects. It's a website designed for Source Control, 
                        which allows revisions on documents to be tracked, saved, and reverted back to at anytime during a projects
                        lifetime. I began using it a few months ago, so getting it set up for this assignment was, thankfully, easy
                        enough. SCM errors are some of my least favorite things in this world.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Next, I began working on my website. The first idea that popped into my head was to create one for my video
                        game I'm currently working on. It would allow me to have several pages, meet all the criteria for the assignment,
                        and possibly use it once I launch the game. So I set out to code it. I ended up downloading VS Code, which is from
                        Microsoft, and is a brilliant code editor. It made writing HTML and CSS extremely easy and quick.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        After starting to code, I decided to work on the home page first. I had to look up a lot of the code, as I was a little rusty, and
                        I had to learn what bootstrap could do. <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/default.asp">W3 Schools</a> was a great website to learn from.
                        I'm not a designer, but I did my best to make my home page exciting and to get people interested in the game.
                        Once the navbar was created and set in place, I created the other pages and copied the code over to them.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Once I had the skeelton of the website up and running, I set to filling it up with content. While doing so, I checked over the
                        requirements that homework wanted, like a table, lists, etc.. After a couple of days working on the website, I was finished!
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Then I set on creating a portfolio website and getting GitHub Pages working. It was a little bit of a pain, but
                        in the end, as you can see, it all worked out!
                    </li>
