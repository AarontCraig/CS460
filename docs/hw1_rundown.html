        <p>In the first assignment we were tasked to learn Git, create a repo and work from it, build our own
            website using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. I'd never heard of bootstrap before, but I'd worked with
            all of the other tools/langugaes before, so I was confident I could complete the homework. Design work,
            like website creation is some of my least favorite work, but technically speaking I think I was able
            to meet all of the requirements of the homework.

            <li>To begin, I created an account on GitHub.com. It's a fantastic website for hosting anything, but
                works especially well for code and computer projects. It's a website designed for Source Control, 
                which allows revisions on documents to be tracked, saved, and reverted back to at anytime during a projects
                lifetime. I began using it a few months ago, so getting it set up for this assignment was, thankfully, easy
                enough. SCM errors are some of my least favorite things in this world.

                Next, I began working on my website. The first idea that popped into my head was to create one for my video
                game I'm currently working on. It would allow me to have several pages, meet all the criteria for the assignment,
                and possibly use it once I launch the game. So I set out to code it. I ended up downloaded VS Code, which is from
                Microsoft, and is a brilliant code editor. It made writing HTML and CSS extremely easy and quick.
