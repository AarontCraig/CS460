                                This homework was to take the previous assignment and deply it through Azure. I thought it would be nice
                                and easy, but I was wrong. I never got the ajax functioning properly, although the rest of the process
                                did go fairly smoothly.
                        </p>
                        <ol class="rundown">
                            <li>
                                The first thing I did was to sign up for Azure. It's a pretty simple process and they gave me $200 in credit
                                for their services.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Then I began researching how to deply to Azure. Turns out, the process is pretty straight forward and
                                most of it can be done within my VS application. So I did that, deploying to the cloud, and got by Website
                                up and running really fast.

                            </li>
                            <li>
                                I had to alter my connection to the database, to allow it to be access online.
                                <img src="Homework9\Images\Connection_Settings.PNG" height="600" width="1000">
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Then my problems started with Ajax. It worked locally just fine, but on Azure it wouldn't accept
                                the data my controller would pass back. It's something I"m still trying to figure out.
                            </li>
                            <p>
                                I'd say I learned to never put off something simple until later, because it can turn out to be the 
                                most difficult project of the term..
