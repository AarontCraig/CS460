                        <p>In this assignment I learned to code in C#. I learned a lot of the basics, included using namespaces, naming
                            conventions, and using the debugger. I found myself confused at first, but then I fell in love with the language.
                            It seems really fantastic and I am excited to learn more and use it more often.
                        </p>

                            <li>The first thing I did was to create a new branch on my github website. I did this using the git commands:
                                <br><code>git branch -b hw3</code>
                                <br><code>git checkout hw3</code>
                                <br>And then I began working on that branch, pushing changes, creating files, all without affecting my main
                                branch. Source control is truly amazing, and I wil be using it in all future projects, for almost any class
                                I have.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Secondly I opened up the Java program Calculator and looked it over. There were 4 files and a fair bit of code,
                                I tried to understand how it worked, ran the calculator a couple of times, and got a good feeling for the program.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Then I began working in Visual Studio 2017.
                                <br><img src="HW 3\Images\VS Screenshot.PNG" height="400" width="750" alt="Screenshot of website"><br>
                                I've used Visual Studio in the past, but never too much. I found myself a little intimidated, as it's a mature
                                program with a lot of menus and options. However, I was able to get a hold of the basics fairly quickly and
                                found myself a good workflow.

                                Up next came the actual translation of the code from Java to C#. I started with the interface and translated it
                                into C# that ended up looking like this: 
                                <xmp>
                                        public interface IStackADT
                                        {
                                            /// <summary>
                                            /// Push an item onto the top of the stack. Pushing an object that 
                                            /// doesn't exist should result in an error and should not succeed.
                                            /// Pushing an object that is not an item should result in an error.
                                            /// This operation returns a reference (pointer or link, but not a copy)
                                            /// to the item pushed so that an anonymous object can be pushed and then used.
                                            /// </summary>
                                            /// <param name="newItem">The object to push onto the top of the stack. Should not be null</param>
                                            /// <returns>A reference to the object that was pushed, or null if newItem == null</returns>
                                            Object Push(Object newItem);
                                        
                                            /// <summary>
                                            /// Remove and return the top item on the stack. This operation should 
                                            /// result in an error if the stack is empty.Returns a reference to the
                                            /// item removed.
                                            /// </summary>
                                            /// <returns>A reference to the item currently on the top of the stack or null if the stack is empty</returns>
                                            Object Pop();
                                        
                                            /// <summary>
                                            /// Return the top item but do not remove it. Generally should result in 
                                            /// an error if the stack is empty.An acceptable alternative is to return 
                                            /// something which the user can use to check to see if the stack was in fact empty.
                                            /// </summary>
                                            /// <returns></returns>
                                            Object Peek();
                                        
                                            /// <summary>
                                            /// Query the stack to see if it is empty or not. Cannot produce an error.
                                            /// </summary>
                                            /// <returns>True if the stack is empty, false otherwise</returns>
                                            Boolean IsEmpty();
                                        
                                            /// <summary>
                                            /// Reset the stack by emptying it. The exact technique used to clear 
                                            /// the stack is up to the implementor.The user should pay attention to what 
                                            /// this behavior is.
                                            /// </summary>
                                            void Clear();
                                </xmp>>
                                I learned how to use XML comments, which are fabulous. They allow me to see exactly what that function
                                does when I call it later on.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Once I began to get comfortable with C#, the translation came along well. The only trouble I had
                                was when I needed to translate the Java Scanner class into C#, since C# doesn't have anything
                                exactly like it. I ended up coding this:
                                <xmp>
                                        String fullString;
                                        String[] subStrings;
                                        Double a, b, c, number;
                            
                                        fullString = input;
                                        subStrings = fullString.Split(); //Split the string into an array
                                        foreach (String str in subStrings )
                                        {
                                            if (Double.TryParse(str, out number) == true) //If it's a number, push it onto the stack
                                            {
                                                stack.Push(number);
                                            }
                                </xmp>
                                After that got solved, I got my calculator up and running with the help of the debugger, which is 
                                a great tool and very easy to use.
                            </li>
                            <p>I really enjoyed learning C#, it's a great language that's similar to what I already know, which makes 
                                it even easier to get into it.
