                            In this assignment, I had to create my own database with references and use Ajax to display some of their artwork
                            on the page dynamically, depending on what button the user clicked on.
                        </p>

                            <li>I created a new branch for this project, but I was working on multiple machines, and I kept forgetting
                                to change branches when changing and my branches got really messed up. I did use them, and eventually merged
                                them but they may be a difficult to follow.
                            </li>

                            <li>
                                To begin, I looked at the database we were supposed to create and the relationships they needed to have. Some of
                                them were fairly obvious, but I still needed to plan out how they would work. I took to drawing up a sketch, a very
                                rough Entity Relationship Diagram:
                                <br><br>

                            </li>
                            <li>
                                After I had an idea of how they would be related, I set to writing the SQL needed to created the tables in 
                                the database. I needed to set primary keys and foreign keys to reference other tables, which was a little tricky
                                at first. But I ended up with this code:
                                <xmp>
CREATE TABLE dbo.ARTIST (
    [ID] INT IDENTITY (1, 1) NOT NULL,
    [NAME] VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    [DOB] DATE NOT NULL,
    [BIRTHCITY] VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    CONSTRAINT [PK_dbo.ARTIST] PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED (ID)
);

CREATE TABLE dbo.ARTWORK (
    [ID] INT IDENTITY (1, 1) NOT NULL,
    [TITLE] VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    [ARTIST] INT FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES dbo.ARTIST(ID) NOT NULL,
    CONSTRAINT [PK_dbo.ARTWORK] PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED (ID)
);

CREATE TABLE dbo.GENRE (
    [ID] INT IDENTITY (1, 1) NOT NULL,
    [NAME] VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    CONSTRAINT [PK_dbo.GENRE] PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED (ID)
);

CREATE TABLE dbo.CLASSIFICATION (
    [ID] INT IDENTITY (1, 1) NOT NULL,
    [ARTWORK] INT FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES dbo.ARTWORK(ID) NOT NULL,
    [GENRE] INT FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES dbo.GENRE(ID) NOT NULL,
    CONSTRAINT [PK_dbo.CLASSIFICATION] PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED (ID)
);
                                </xmp>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Once that was complete, I set up the controllers and views associated with them, which gave me CRUD
                                functionality for all of my tables. I auto generated these which was great, since Visual Studio took care
                                of most of the haavy lifting.
                                <br><br>
                                <img src="Homework8\Images\Controllers.PNG" height="600" width="1000">
                                <br>
                                Once those were in place, I could add and delete Artists, paintings, and everything from my web app.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                So my next task was to insert data. At first I did this manually through my web app, but I quickly realized
                                that this wouldn't work, as my database can easily reset. So I figured out how to insert into my tables,
                                even though they had references to others.
                                <xmp>
    INSERT INTO dbo.ARTIST VALUES
    ('M.C. Escher', '06/17/1898', 'Leeuwarden, Netherlands'),
    ('Leonardo Da Vinci', '05/2/1519', 'Vinci, Italy'),
    ('Hatip Mehmed Efendi', '11/18/1680', 'Unkown'),
    ('Salvador Dali', '05/11/1904', 'Figueres, Spain');
    
INSERT INTO dbo.ARTWORK VALUES
    ('Circle Limit III', '1'),
    ('Twon Tree', '1'),
    ('Mona Lisa', '2'),
    ('The Vitruvian Man', '2'),
    ('Ebru', '3'),
    ('Honey Is Sweeter Than Blood', '4');

INSERT INTO dbo.GENRE VALUES 
    ('Tesselation'),
    ('Surrealism'),
    ('Portrait'),
    ('Renaissance');

INSERT INTO dbo.CLASSIFICATION VALUES
    (1, 1),
    (2, 1),
    (2, 2),
    (3, 3),
    (3, 4),
    (4, 4),
    (5, 1),
    (6, 2);
                                </xmp>
                                <br>
                                This worked, and I was amazed at how they were all connected and that the auto genereated controllers used
                                the references when making new Artworks and such.
                                <br><br>
                                <img src="Homework8\Images\Artists_Page.PNG" height="600" width="1000">
                                <br>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The last thing I did was set up the ajax to display artworks by genre on the main page. I set up some buttons
                                using razor, and then connected their click to an ajax event to append data to an invisible div.
                                <xmp>
function display(id) {
    var clickedID = id;
    $.ajax({
        url: "/Home/Index",
        data: {
            ID: id
        },
        type: "POST",
        dataType: 'json',
        success: function (data) {
            $('.toDelete').remove();
            for (var i = 0; i < data.length; ++i)
            {
                $('#details').append("<p class=\"toDelete\">" + "<b>Artist: </b>" + data[i].ArtistName) + "</p>";
                $('#details').append("<p class=\"toDelete\">" + "<b>Title: </b>" + data[i].Artwork) + "</p><br>";
                $('#details').css({
                    'padding' : 20
                });
                $('#details').append('<br class=\"toDelete\">');
            }
        }
    });
}
                                </xmp>
                                <br>
                                <img src="Homework8\Images\Home_Displaying.PNG" height="600" width="1000">

                            </li>
                            <p>
                                This turned out great and it all worked. I was happy with it and definitely felt more confident
                                working with ajax and databases.
