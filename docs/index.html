                            <p>For my 4th homework, I began to learn ASP.net using MVC. It's about splitting up the code into logical sections, the Model, View, and
                                Controller. Seperation creates a workflow that's easy to follow and debug, if anything goes wrong. I created a little
                                website that takes some of your information and calculates your awesome level, based on that information. I do the calculation
                                in my web app, and then return that on the webpage. It's type safe, so the user must enter valid values or nothing will
                                proceed.

                            <p>In my third assignment I began learning about C#. I'd never used C# before, but I had heard of the language,
                                as it's the primary language of Unity for designing games. I always thought it was similar to C++, but I now
                                realize that they're completely different. I transcribed a postfix calculator from Java to C#, learning the
                                basics of the language and how to use it.

                                GIT. I couldn't think of anything I wanted to create for personal projects, so I just created a simple site
                                that takes input from the user and guesses at their future. It's a silly website, but along the way I learned
                                a lot of about javascript and jquery.
