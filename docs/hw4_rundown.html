                        <p>In this assignment I learned about the MVC paradigm, and how to transfer data around using a web browser.
                            It's not the most elegant way of moving data, but there are reasons to use it that way. I learned that I 
                            can manipulate data that the user gives me, and then change the page they're looking at with Razor code!
                        </p>
                        <ol class="rundown">
                            <li>The first thing I did was to create a new branch on my github website. I did this using the git commands:
                                <br><code>git branch -b hw4</code>
                                <br><code>git checkout hw4</code>
                                <br>And then I began working on that branch, pushing changes, creating files, all without affecting my main
                                branch. For this project, I also created subbranches based off hw4, such as hw4_home, and one for each page
                                as I worked. At the end, I merged them all together.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                To begin the coding process, I created the controller I'd be using. The controller would handle all requests for
                                my webpages, how data was handled, and the functions I'd eventually create.
                                <img src="HW4\Images\vs_project.PNG" height="400" width="600">
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Once the controller was made, I needed to create a view for the first page. It was to be a temperature converter,
                                to do either Farenheit to Celsius, or vice versa. I added the page in my controller so I could access it, then
                                set up the page for how it would look with labels and inputs.
                                <br><br>
                                On this first page, I was to take the information as query strings and extract it and then do the calculation. I 
                                did that successfully and displayed the result to the user.
                                <img src="HW4\Images\Page_1.PNG" height="200" width="600">
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Then came page 2, when I needed to use the same code but transfer the data in a new way. I needed to use HttpGet
                                and HttpPost. To simplify the conversion, I made it into a function that I called for both pages, and then 
                                created the ActionResult calls for the get and post.
                                <img src="HW4\Images\Page_2.PNG" height="200" width="600">
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Next I began brainstorming what to do. I needed to create a webpage that took user information, and then performed
                                some sort of calculation on it. The suggestion was for an interest calculator, which I actually just learned the 
                                formulas for in my math class, but I wanted to do something unique instead. As I'm currently playing Dark Souls 3,
                                it came to my mind to make a calculator that took into account the users age and number of games completed, to give
                                them an awesome ranking. The code looked like this:
                                <br>
                                <xmp>
                                    [HttpPost]
                                    public ActionResult Awesome_Calculator(string name, int? age, int? gamesBeaten)
                                    {
                                        //Error checking for all three types
                                        try
                                        {
                                            Convert.ToDouble(name);
                                            ViewBag.name = null;
                                        }
                                        catch
                                        {
                                            ViewBag.name = name;
                                        }
                            
                                        if (age < 0 || age > 100)
                                            ViewBag.age = null;
                                        else
                                            ViewBag.age = age;
                            
                                        if (gamesBeaten < 0 || gamesBeaten > 3)
                                            ViewBag.gamesBeaten = null;
                                        else
                                            ViewBag.gamesBeaten = gamesBeaten;
                                        //if (age == null)
                                        //return new HttpStatusCodeResult(HttpStatusCode.BadRequest);
                            
                                        //Discern awewsomeness level
                                        ViewBag.aweLevel = (gamesBeaten * 10000) - (age * 50);
                                        return View();
                                </xmp>
                                And the result of the page, when their awesomenss was calculated looked like this:
                                <img src="HW4\Images\form_filled_out.PNG" height="400" width="600">

                            </li>
                            <p>
                                All in all, I learned a lot about creating web pages, web apps, and passing data in a browser.
                                It's something I'd never done before, so it was a litle difficult, but I feel I learned a lot
                                and am a better developer because of it. You can get the app <a href="https://github.com/AarontCraig/CS460/tree/hw4/docs/HW4/HW4(test2)">here on my github</a> as long as
