                        <p>For our second assignment we were tasked to learn javascript, jquery, and the best practices with GIT. I decided
                            to do a silly project that involved a website where the user can type in their name and receive a guess at their
                            future. (I take no responsibility for what anyone does with that information). Along the way I learned a lot about
                            javascript and jquery. I already knew most everything about GIT, branching, merging, etc.. But it was still good
                            practice for me.
                        </p>
                        <ol class="rundown">
                            <li>The first thing I did was to create a new branch on my github website. I did this using the git commands:
                                <br><code>git branch -b hw2</code>
                                <br><code>git checkout hw2</code>
                                <br>And then I began working on that branch, pushing changes, creating files, all without affecting my main
                                branch. Source control is truly amazing, and I wil be using it in all future projects, for almost any class
                                I have.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Up next was the website. The first idea that came to my mind was a fortune telling website of some kind. A place
                                where the user can put in their name, maybe some other information, and then I return a "fortune" based on that
                                infortmation from them. It was meant to be silly and funny, and to get me familiar with the basics of javascript
                                and jquery; which it did a great job at. I learned to code in a new language, using code like this:
                                <br><xmp>
                                        function clickMeButton() {
                                            var input = document.getElementsByClassName("leftBars");
                                            var i;
                                                for(i = 0; i < input.length; ++i) {
                                                    input[i].style.display = "block";
                                                }
                                        }
                                    </xmp><br>
                                    It was really thrilling to have my website come alive at clicks and input from the user.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Through a lot of research and trial and error, I eventually got the website up and running to my satisfaction.
                                Probably the most difficult part of it was getting it to fade out of existance slowly, and then come back to life.
                                The code to do that, looked like this:
                                <br><xmp>
                                        interval = 0;
                                        function revertOpacity() {
                                            clearInterval(interval);
                                            fade = 1;
                                            $("body").css("opacity", "1");
                                            //Clear all the other elements
                                            $(".leftBars, #resultsButton, #dareButton").css("display", "none");
                                            x = document.getElementById("header");
                                            x.innerHTML = "Now the results!";
                                            $("#header").css("color", "Red");
                                            fillResultsDiv();
                                        }
                                </xmp><br>
                                It took a lot of effort and confusion on my part, but eventually it got working correctly.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                And then lastly, I created the cheesy fortune results for the user. The code for that is incredibly simple,
                                but I did use a function to get the current date and time, teaching me to how use data built into the DOM:
                                <br><xmp>
                                        function fillResultsDiv() {
                                            list = $("#resultsList");
                                            var m = "m";
                                            //Set first element from different choices
                                            if(fName.value.length <= 4)
                                                list.html("<li>You will live a short life</li>");
                                            else if(fName.value.length > 4)
                                                list.html("<li>You will live a long life</li>");
                                            //Set second element
                                            if(String(lName).charCodeAt(0) < m.charCodeAt(0))
                                                list.append("<li>You will get rich soon</li>");
                                            else if(String(lName).charCodeAt(0) >= m.charCodeAt(0))
                                                list.append("<li>You won't be making much money in your life</li>");
                                            //Set last element
                                            var d = new Date();
                                            if((d.getTime() % 2) === 0)
                                                list.append("<li>You'll find your soulmate soon</li>");
                                            else
                                                list.append("<li>Good luck being happy!</li>");
                                        }
                                </xmp><br>
