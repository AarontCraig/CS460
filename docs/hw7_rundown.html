                            For this homework I was assigned to create a web application that connected with Giphy's API. I needed
                            to allow the uesr to search for Gifs and then update the page using Ajax.
                        </p>
                        <ol class="rundown">
                            <li>The first thing I did was to create a new branch on my github website. I did this using the git commands:
                                <br><code>git branch -b HW7</code>
                                <br><code>git checkout HW7</code>
                                <br>And then I began working on that branch, pushing changes, creating files, all without affecting my main
                                branch. At the end, I merged them all together. This was the only part I didn't have any problems with.
                            </li>
                            <img src="Homework7\Images\Home.PNG" height="600" width="1000">
                            <br><br>
                            <li>
                                The easiest part was setting up the home page. As the projet was only one page, it didn't take long
                                to get set up and looking decent. Once that was finished, I moved on to trying to figure out how to 
                                do Get requests in C#.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                I signed up with Giphy as a developer, which was very simple and easy, then began exploring their docs
                                and reading over their API.
                                <br><br>
                                <img src="Homework7\Images\Giphy_Docs.PNG" height="600" width="1000">
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Right along with that, was hiding my developer key in my application, as I didn't want to put it inside of my
                                repo. It's not safe there, even if it's in a private repo. So, following the instructions of class, I hid
                                my key outside of my repo doing this:
                                <br><br>
                                <xmp>
<appSettings file="..\..\..\..\GiphyAPIKey.config"></appSettings>

string apiKey = System.Web.Configuration.WebConfigurationManager.AppSettings["GiphyKey"];
                                </xmp>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                After that I endeavored to learn using a REST Api using C# commands. This proved difficult, as Giphy had no
                                docs for accessing their data using C#, so I had to look elsewhere. After a lot of searching, I discovered
                                the WebRequest class and all that went along with it. I was able to query the Giphy servers using this code:
                                <br><br>
                                <xmp>
WebRequest request = WebRequest.Create("http://api.giphy.com/v1/gifs/search?q=" + q + "&limit=20&rating=" + rating + "&api_key=" + apiKey); //Requests the data from the url
WebResponse response = request.GetResponse(); //Gets everything back from that website into one object
Stream dataStream = response.GetResponseStream(); //Gets the response I want back, the json object
StreamReader reader = new StreamReader(dataStream); //Decodes the stream
string responseFromServer = reader.ReadToEnd(); //Saves it into a string
                                </xmp>
                                <br>
                                The q and rating are data that are passed in from the website, the user typing in their query and
                                choosing a rating. At first I had to hard code those values in, until I figured out how to use Ajax.
                                <br><br>
                                <img src="Homework7\Images\CatSearch.PNG" height="600" width="1000">
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The ajax took me a long time to figure out, as I just didn't understand how it worked or even what language to 
                                use. I thought it was a new language, but it's an extension of Javascript and Jquery. Eventually I figured
                                it out and my code looked like this:
                                <br><br>
                                <xmp>
function update() {
var query = document.getElementById("searchBar").value;
var rating = 0;
if (document.getElementById("y").checked)
    rating = "y";
else if (document.getElementById("g").checked)
    rating = "g";
else if (document.getElementById("pg").checked)
    rating = "pg";
else if (document.getElementById("pg-13").checked)
    rating = "pg-13";
else
    rating = "r";
$.ajax({
    url: "/Search/Index",
    data: {
        q: query,
        rating: rating
    },
    dataType: "json",
    type: "GET",
    success: function (data) {
        $('.gif').remove();
        for (var i = 0; i < data.length; ++i) {
            $("#gifs").append("<img src=\"" + data[i].url + "\" " + "class=\"gif\" />");
            $('#gifs img').css({
                'width': 200,
                'height': 200
            });
        }
    }
});
}
                                </xmp>
                                <br>
                                The update function would get called when the search button was clicked.
                            </li>
                            <p>
                                I finally finished the project and felt pretty good about it all. I learned how to use the REST API, or at least
                                the basics of it, and learned some Ajax.
