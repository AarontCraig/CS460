                        <p>
                            For this homework, I needed to create a new database, link it in my MVC app, and be able to add, delete, and view
                            everthing in that DB on my website. This homework was the most difficult for me yet, I ran into so many errors,
                            bugs, and wrung my hair until I was almost bald. But in the end, with help from other students and my professor,
                            I was able to get it up and running.
                        </p>
                        <ol class="rundown">
                            <li>The first thing I did was to create a new branch on my github website. I did this using the git commands:
                                <br><code>git branch -b hw5</code>
                                <br><code>git checkout hw5</code>
                                <br>And then I began working on that branch, pushing changes, creating files, all without affecting my main
                                branch. At the end, I merged them all together. This was the only part I didn't have any problems with.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                After switching to my branch, I downloaded the example project from class and attempted to get it working. However,
                                I was gone the day we went over setting up a DB in VS and so I didn't know anything about connection strings, or 
                                how to connect to the DB, so I struggled for a long time over this.
                                <br><br>
                                I created my own project and attempted to connect to it, but it was all for nothing without the correct knowledge.
                                I made my SQL script, but didn't connect to my DB, I was on master, which was doing nothing for me. Once I finally
                                understood more about connections, I was able to discern how to switch DB's and which one I needed to be on.

                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Then I made my User.cs Model. Here, I set up how VS should get the information from the database, and how to format it
                                on the website.
                                <xmp>
                                    namespace Homework5.Models
                                    {
                                        public class User
                                        {
                                            public int ID { get; set; }
                                    
                                            [Display(Name = "Drivers License #")]
                                            public int DriversLicense { get; set; }
                                    
                                            [Display(Name = "First Name")]
                                            public string FirstName { get; set; }
                                    
                                            [Display(Name = "Middle Name")]
                                            public string MiddleName { get; set; }
                                    
                                            [Display(Name = "Last Name")]
                                            public string LastName { get; set; }

                                            .....
                                </xmp>
                                I altered the display property for many of them, so in the form they would show up properly.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                I thought things were going to be easy sailing from there, but I was dead wrong. Auto correct had
                                changed one tiny thing when I made my UserContext.cs file, and it resulted in me not being able to auto
                                generate any my controllers or views, which are fairly important. My professor eventually found this error,
                                and with it fixed, I was able to proceed smoothly.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Finally I got my index page created and my database connected to it. It displayed the users that I'd added from my
                                SQL file.
                                <img src="Homework5\Images\Index_Picture.PNG" height="400" width="600">
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                From there, it was pretty easy to get the create page set up, since Visual Studio helped me generate the page
                                and fill it up. I added some design work to it to make it look better.
                                <img src="Homework5\Images\New_User_Screenshot.PNG" height="400" width="600">
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                And lastly, my index was updated with the new user I created, showing that my database was linked properly
                                and I could both fetch data from it and push data to it.

                                    <br>
                            </li>
                            <p>
                                I had nothing but problems working through this homework. I was constantly frustrated and wanted to give up.
                                But through it all, I learned a lot. I was then able to take that knowledge and help out my classmates when they
                                asked questions as well, since I knew what they were going through and how to fix it.
